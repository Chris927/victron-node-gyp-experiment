# Experimental: NodeJS module that builds on Venus OS

[Venus OS](https://github.com/victronenergy/venus) is
[Victron's](https://www.victronenergy.com/) operating system for devices like
the [Cerbo
GX](https://www.victronenergy.com/upload/documents/Datasheet-Cerbo-GX-GX-Touch-EN.pdf).

With this package, I am experimentally building a NodeJS package with [native
NodeJS extensions](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#node-api).


# How to Try

(TODO: more context required)

```bash
npm run build
node test-me.js
```

This will output `world`, if all went well.
